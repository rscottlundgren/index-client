## Planning
Project 2 was considerably more open ended in scope than the prior project ("Tic-Tac-Toe"). Ultimately I struggled and weighed the options between three apps that I had designs for (all tumbling around in my brain space) and landed on "Critical Index". After spending some time writing out some ideas of what I, as a developer, wanted out of this site, I began the process of designing the site. The first version would rely heavily on the development of a character generator. This feature would help to inform the following features that I had in mind for the site. With that in mind, I wireframed out the site until I had a good direction to head in. These wireframes were also heavily informed by the Dungeons & Dragons 3.5e character sheet (linked below).

Once wireframed, I began the process of building out the backend API (those experiences can be found documented in that specific repo). Once the back-end API was "finished" I began working on the client-side application. In the initial testing phase I borrowed heavily from my first project, specifically from the code that I had originally built that would allow me to test authentication. With that successfully tested, I built out the remaining functions required in this project (specifically, create a character, update a character, show all characters, show one character, delete a character). Once those forms were "built" and tested, I had MVP in the best sense (black lines on a white page, ya'll!).

I reached out for guidance on how to move forward with building out the API and while I waited for a response, I began making all of the aesthetic changes that I wanted so the app would come off as more professional and presentation ready. This meant reformatting/rebuilding the forms, redesigning the buttons, creating inline forms, and a host of other changes. At this stage, what helped the most was the documentation provided by Bootstrap. In the first project I wanted to do what I wanted to do and spent a good amount of time fighting with Bootstrap and ignoring the documentation. This time, I read what seemed relevant in the documentation and it made all the difference - this time it was much less of a fight and more of a coaxing experience.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge for me at this stage was probably scoping coupled with concern over making sure that my API was utilizing tables in a manner that made sense. I'll cover the latter more in the README for that repo. With the former, as in the first project, I dreamed rather big. This became a concept that will take me far beyond the three-month attendance in this course and it's a project that, while it could be done alone, would also make more sense to do in collaboration with others. With that in mind, I had to figure out what part of this project would be the smallest, most useful piece to code as a submission. It ultimately came down to the smallest piece I could think of, which is the character generator, but even that was a mountain of a task, so breaking that down into bite-sized bits was a challenge. Ultimately, as a result of this exercise, I realized the importance of scoping to the smallest milestones that you can come up with and planning those out in a way that makes the most sense from a timeline perspective (with only the information that I have at the time).
